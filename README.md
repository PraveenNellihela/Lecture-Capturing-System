# Lecture-Capturing-System

This project can identify a whiteboard and the lecturer from a live video feed, exctract them seperately and combine the frames together with desktop screen recording to produce a comprehensive lecture video.
<ul>
<li>record video and audio</li>
<li>detecting the whiteboard with TF classifier</li>
<li>combining sliced whiteboard from video frames with desktop recording</li>
</ul>
are done in parallel.

External resources that helped with developing the TF model were from https://github.com/EdjeElectronics
